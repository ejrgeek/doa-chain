## üìç Public Roadmap

DoaChain is a project that is likely to be constantly evolving, with several improvements and new features planned. This roadmap provides an overview of future steps.

### üü¢ Phase 1: Initial Development (‚úÖ Completed)

- Creation of the smart contract:
    - Definition of the main features (creation of campaigns, donations, withdrawals, etc.).
    - Implementation of validations to ensure integrity of campaigns and transactions.

- Local configuration:
    - Deployment on a local node using Truffle and Foundry.

- Initial documentation:
    - Creation of README.md detailing the project.

- Test planning:
    - Structuring the plan for implementing tests with Truffle.

### üîµ Phase 2: Deployment in Test Environment (‚è≥ In Progress)
- Testnet Deployment:
    - Deployment of the contract in an Ethereum testnet.
    - Setting up a test environment with simulated wallets.

- Functional Testing:
    - Implementation of test cases in JavaScript using Truffle.
    - Validation of all contract functions in a testnet environment.

- Feedback and Reviews:
    - Collect feedback from potential users and review the code based on suggestions.

### üü° Phase 3: dApp Development (üöß In Planning)
- Interactive Frontend:
    - Development of a decentralized application (dApp) to interact with the contract.
    - Suggested technologies: React.js or Next.js with Web3.js/Ethers.js.

- Wallet Connection:
    - Integration with Metamask to facilitate the use of wallets.

- UI/UX for campaigns:
    - Intuitive design to create, view and donate to campaigns directly in the dApp.

- Deployment of the dApp in a public environment:
- Hosting on a service such as Vercel, Netlify or IPFS.

### üü° Phase 4: Advanced Support (üöß In Planning)
- Stablecoins and ERC-20 Tokens:
    - Allow donations using stablecoins such as USDC or USDT.
    - Percentage-based fee:
    - Implement a variable fee system that adjusts according to the amount raised.

- Audit Integration:
    - Review the contract by third-party auditing services to ensure security.

- Decentralized Governance:
    - Explore the possibility of adding a governance mechanism to set fees or make future decisions.

### üü° Phase 5: Deployment on Mainnet (üöß In Planning)
- Deployment on Mainnet:
    - Launch of the contract on Ethereum Mainnet or another blockchain with greater scalability (Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, etc.).

- Project Promotion:
    - Disclosure to NGOs, content creators, and communities interested in crowdfunding.

- External Contributions:
    - Accept suggestions and improvements from the community to expand the project.

- Gamification of Campaigns:
    - Implementation of symbolic rewards for the most active donors.

- Impact Reports:
    - Tools for campaign creators to generate impact reports based on fundraising.

- Scalability:
    - Study of migration to blockchains with lower gas costs (Arbitrum, Optimism, etc.).
